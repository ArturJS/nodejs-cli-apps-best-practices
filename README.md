## (2) Distribution

This section deals with best practices concerned with distributing and packaging a Node.js command line application in an optimal matter for consumers.

### (2.1) Prefer a small dependency footprint

‚úÖ **Do:**
Minimize your use of production dependencies, use alternative dependencies which are smaller, and vet your dependencies footprint as well for transitive dependencies cost to ensure an overall small bundle of the Node.js CLI. Be careful to not over-optimize on dependencies by reinventing the wheel.

‚ùå **Otherwise:**
The size and use of dependencies in the application will impact the install time of your Node.js CLI, potentially providing a poor user experience.

<details>
	<summary>‚û°Ô∏è <b>Details</b></summary>

A fast npm install for Node.js CLIs invoked with `npx` will provide a better user experience. This is made possible when the overall dependency and transitive dependency footprint is kept to a reasonable size.

Where-as with a global npm installation of a package, a slow-to-install npm package will be a one-off poor experience, the use of `npx` for users to invoke executable packages is more significant and visible in its degraded performance due to npx always fetching and installing packages from the registry.

</details>

## (3) Interoperability

This section deals with best practices concerned with making the Node.js CLI seamlessly integrate with other command line tools and conventions which are natural for CLIs to operate in.

This section answer questions such as:

- _Can I export the output of this CLI for easy parsing?_
- _Can I pipe the output of this CLI to the input of another command line tool?_
- _Can I pipe the result of another tool to this CLI?_

### (3.1) Accept input as STDIN

‚úÖ **Do:**
For command line applicatios that are expected to work with data, make it available for a consumer to pipe the data to standard input (STDIN).

‚ùå **Otherwise:**
Other command line applications will not be able to provide their result, directly as input for the CLI you build and it prevents common UNIX one-liners such as:

```bash
$ curl -s "https://api.example.com/data.json" | your_node_cli
```

<details>
	<summary>‚û°Ô∏è <b>Details</b></summary>

If the command line application works with data, such as performing some kind of task on a JSON file, which is usually specified with `--file <file.json>` command line argument

</details>

### (3.2) Enable structured output

‚úÖ **Do:**
Enable a flag to allow structured output of the program's result, if such result is available, to enable parsing and easy manipulation of the data.

‚ùå **Otherwise:**
Users of the CLI may need to apply complicated regex parsing and matching techniques to extract the output data provided by your CLI.

<details>
	<summary>‚û°Ô∏è <b>Details</b></summary>

It is often useful for users of a command line application to parse the data and perform other tasks with it, such as using it to feed web dashboards, email notifications.

Being able to easily extract the data of interest from a command line output provides a friendlier experience to consumers of the CLI.

</details>

## (4) Accessibility

This section deals with best practices concerned with making a Node.js CLI application available to users who wish to consume it but are lacking an ideal environment than that which the maintainer designed the application.

### (4.1) Containerize the CLI

‚úÖ **Do:**
Create a docker image for the CLI and publish it to a public registry like Docker Hub so that users without a Node.js environment can use it.

‚ùå **Otherwise:**
Users without a Node.js environment will not have `npm` easily available and won't be able to run your CLI application.

<details>
	<summary>‚û°Ô∏è <b>Details</b></summary>

Installing Node.js CLI applications from the npm registry will typically be done with Node.js native toolchain such as `npm` or `npx`. These are common across JavaScript and Node.js developers, and are expected to be referenced within install instructions.

However, if you are targeting a CLI application to be consumed by the general public, regardless of their affiliation with JavaScript or availability of this tooling, then distributing the CLI application only in the form of an install from the npm registry will be restricting. Moreover, if the CLI application is intended to be used in a build or CI environment then those may also be required to install Node.js related toolchain dependencies.

There are many forms of packaging and distributing an executable and containerizing it as a Docker container that is pre-bundled with your CLI application is an easily consumable alternative and dependency-free (aside of requiring a Docker environment ready).

</details>

### (4.3) Node.js versions compatibility

‚úÖ **Do:**
Target old versions of Node.js such as Node.js 6 or Node.js 4 (both are End of Life) using a transpiler such as Babel to make sure the generated code is compliant with the version of V8 JavaScript engine shipped with those versions.

Another workaround is to provide a container version of the CLI to avoid old targets. See Section [(4.1) Containerize the CLI](#containerize-the-cli).

‚ùå **Otherwise:**
Don't level down the program code to use an older ECMAScript language specification that matches unmaintained or EOL Node.js versions that you target as this will only lead to complex code maintenance in time and will warrant a technical debt from the beginning.

<details>
	<summary>‚û°Ô∏è <b>Details</b></summary>

Sometimes it may be necessary to specifically target older Node.js versions which are missing new ECAMScript specification. For example, if you are building a Node.js CLI that is mostly geared towards DevOps or IT, they may not have an ideal Node.js environment with an up to date runtime. As a reference, Debian Stretch (oldstable) ships with [Node.js 8.11.1](https://packages.debian.org/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names&keywords=nodejs).

</details>

### (4.4) Shebang autodetect the Node.js runtime

‚úÖ **Do:**
Use an installation-agnostic reference in your [Shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) declaration that locates the Node.js runtime automaticaly based on the runtime environment.

‚ùå **Otherwise:**
Using a hard-coded Node.js runtime location such as `#!/usr/local/bin/node` is only specific to your own environment and may render the Node.js CLI inoperable in other environments where the location of Node.js is different.

<details>
	<summary>‚û°Ô∏è <b>Details</b></summary>

It may be an easy start to develop a Node.js CLI by running the entry point file as `node cli.js`, and later on adding `#!/usr/local/bin/node` to the top of the `cli.js` file, however the latter is still a flawed approach to the matter as that filesystem location of the `node` executable is not guaranteed for other users environments.

It should be noted that specifying `#!/usr/bin/env node` as the best practice, is still making the assumption that the Node.js runtime is referrenced as `node` and not `nodejs` or otherwise.
